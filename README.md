# EEO1 Visualizer
The purpose of this project is to allow lay people to visualize employment equal opportunity reports for private companies (EEO-1) that are put up by American companies. We want to help people see and understand the data in a way that informs them of hiring trends across these companies. Data is sourced directly from publically released EEO-1 reports on company websites. 

If you know a source of reputable EEO-1s that we can use to further increase visibility into a company's hiring trends, please contact me.
