            folks in gaining skills to enter the technology workforce in a technology role. This bootcamp is cost-free to participants as it
            is supported by various corporate partners that pay for us to learn these skills. Some of us have leadership ambitions while others are 
            content to be individual contributors. We wanted to see what is the spread and chances we have to fulfill these ambitions. </p>
            <p>While it is true that achieving career ambitions is less a result of statistical probability and more in skills and networking, there still

            <p>The data source we use, EEO-1 reports, only reports the race and binary gender of employees in a given pay period.
                We understand that there are other factors and considerations in diversity such as sexual orientation, 
                disability status, neurodiversity and expansive genders. We do not have access to a reliable, standardized form of
                this data from various companies, so we cannot show it. This project is just the tip of the iceberg of 
                diversity visualization and we hope to be able to discover accessible data to expand into the above
                considerations.
