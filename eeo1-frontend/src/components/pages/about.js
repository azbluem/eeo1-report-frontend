                This is our capstone project, and we chose to focus on diversity efforts in the tech sector because that's the field we're entering.

                folks in gaining skills to enter the technology workforce in a technology role. This bootcamp is cost-free to participants as it
                is supported by various corporate partners that pay for us to learn these skills. Some of us have leadership ambitions while others are 
                content to be individual contributors. We wanted to see what is the spread and chances we have to fulfill these ambitions. </p>
                <p>While it is true that achieving career ambitions is less a result of statistical probability and more in skills and networking, there still
                remains a pervasive idea of stereotypes as well as mentorship and modelling...
